The airframe team is the skeleton of the group.
All systems and equipment of the UAV from other teams is assembled by this team.
For those who fear heights, the airframe team also possesses a UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicle) team which
is responsible for constructing a small ground vehicle with autonomous capabilities.
The restrictions of weight and size make this a challenging task to tackle.
