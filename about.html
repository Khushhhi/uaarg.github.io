    Who we are
</h1>

<p>
    UAARG is a student vehicle project in the Faculty of Engineering. 
    We design and build our own UAV systems, typically of similar 
    size to radio controlled model airplanes. Every year a system is designed, 
    built, tested and then competed internationally. We offer the opportunity 
    for students to put theory into practice and gain valuable design and management experience. If you join the group you will get the following opportunities:

            <p class="content">
                The airframe team deals with maintaining and developing our fleet of UAVs. 
                From designing parts to actual construction (Duct tape included), 
                the airframe team keeps our UAV from falling apart in the sky.

            Way-point navigation, obstacle avoidance and automatic take-off and landing are 
            some of the major systems that the autopilot team works with. Members in this team
            maintain our custom made autopilot software, which ensures that the plane gets to where it needs
            to while keeping away from potential hazards.

                <h2> Imaging </h2>
                Specializing in our UAV's hardware and software imaging systems, the imaging team
                handles vision while in the skies. Not only that, we're working on 
                groundbreaking projects like automated object classification, network supported software and
                image/camera optimization. Don't worry, we won't take your picture without your permission!

                <h2> Systems Integration </h2>
                Someone needs to make sure that everything in the UAV is talking to each other
                properly. The job of the systems integration team is to make sure that all systems 
                can co-exists without blowing each other up. They deal with the UAV as a whole, often working
                with other teams to ensure the quality and reliability of our systems.

                Got a new, innovative idea for our UAV? Come join our R&D team! These members look
                for new ways to improve our current systems while ensuring that everything is well documented.
                Plus, with the rich history that UAARG has, they sift through all of our past records and information
                in case we may have forgotten something important!
