Hi All,

We performed our last competition flight. As a treat here is a video showing take off and landing.

We were given 1hr to generate a report of the flight. Everyone you see below is busy generating the report. Everyone else was having enough free time to take the picture.


Shoutout to Jorge for organizing the report generation

Target areas were superimposed onto a map of the search area.

The final results will be made known tonight.
