Imaging Team develops the machine-vision capabilities of our UAVs.
To accomplish this, we implement primarily software solutions, as well as incorporating hardware
components.
Consequently, our responsibilities also extend beyond only imaging; to support our infrastructure, we
also handle networking, interop server integration and many other software projects.
