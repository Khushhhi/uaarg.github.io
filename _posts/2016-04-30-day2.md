Hi All,

Our first competition flight happend today. I was scheduled for 8:30am so we woke up bright and early to set it. It ended up getting pushed back to ~9:15am. This allowed for a great photo-op.

When the flight actually happened Jorge manned autopilot while Dylan monitored imaging. Our autopilot has been preprogrammed so apart from initiallizing the search area routine these two folks just make sure the plane is operating properly.

Rijesh and Dat were at the runway just chilling. Rijesh only has to fly the plane for landing and takeoff. The rest of the time Dat and him were playing spot the moving spec in the sky. Visual contact at the range is made by competition observers to ensure we stay within our bounds. The aircraft flew ~1.9km from the ground control station.

The flight went swimingly. Are actual flight path is shown below and can be contrasted with simulated one we showed yesterday.

We've made a few tweaks to the autopilot based on this flight. These changes have been implemented for tommorrow's final flight.

Imaging preformed okay. We seem to have been a little out of focus and were experiencing a bit of motion blur. We did manage to cover the entire search area and have some sort of photo for each crop target.
