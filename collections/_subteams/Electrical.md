UAARG's Electrical & Electronics Systems Team is responsible for designing, building and integrating
the various power and communications components on our autonomous air and ground vehicles.
We select components to meet each year's design objectives and monitor our systems' performance and
efficiency throughout testing.
Joining the electrical team offers great opportunities for hands-on wiring work, research into
cutting-edge UAV electronics, and familiarization with the ins and outs of electric propulsion systems!
